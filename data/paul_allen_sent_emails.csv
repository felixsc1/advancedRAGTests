"liane, as we discussed yesterday, i am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the el paso san juan monthly index. a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index. at the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan. we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27. these are the complete list of trades from enron online (eol), enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (amerex, apb, and prebon). please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships. the two key points from this data are as follows: 1. the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & northwest) is consistent between the end of september and october gas daily. it doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers. i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. it is enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business. please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal. sincerely, phillip allen",<23408645.1075855667925.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Thu, 28 Sep 2000 05:56:00 -0700 (PDT",Jeffrey T Hodg

"steve, i am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. if you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. as far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. examine ldc's incentive rate program. current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. the result is that the ldc's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. this creates a shortage in later months. 2. california has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. specific questions should include: 1. why in march '00-may '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. why are there so many examples of ofo's on weekends that push away too much gas from socal's system. i believe socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. they repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. not enough forward hedging is done by the major ldcs. by design the customers are short at a floating rate. this market has been long historically. it has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. call me if you need any more input. phillip",<19155794.1075855699560.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Fri, 22 Dec 2000 07:06:00 -0800 (PST",Steven J Kea

"george, here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. at permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, i feel the 65/35 is a fair split. however, as i mentioned earlier, i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in november) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule this way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 phillip",<2422582.1075855699234.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Tue, 9 Jan 2001 09:51:00 -0800 (PST",<cbpres@austin.rr.com

"by steve everly - the kansas city star date: 01/20/01 22:15 as natural gas prices rose in december, traders at the new york mercantile exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said william burson, a trader. ""it makes the market for natural gas."" but the market's response perplexed chris mcgill, the american gas association's director of gas supply and transportation. he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""it's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" mcgill said. as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street. stephen adik, senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""it's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly. in california, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""we're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said paul snider, a spokesman for missouri gas energy. but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""there's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said ed krapels, director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc., an energy consulting firm in wakefield, mass. hot topic consumers know one thing for certain: their heating bills are up sharply. in many circles, little else is discussed. the rev. vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is facing a $1,456 december bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous december's bill. church members are suffering from higher bills as well. the sunday collection is down, said fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. for the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""it's the talk of the town here,"" he said. a year ago that wasn't a fear. wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. but trouble was brewing. by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. there was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. by early november, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. the federal energy information administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. but $10 gas was coming. below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the kansas city area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""it's all about the weather,"" said krapels of energy security analysis. wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the new york traders. natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. setting the price in the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. in 1990, the new york mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. and big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. that leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. as december began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. by the end of the month it was nearly $10. much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association's weekly storage numbers. utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. still, the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. but when below-normal temperatures arrived in november, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. then the american gas association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. still, said the association's mcgill, there was sufficient gas in storage. but some utility executives didn't share that view. william eliason, vice president of kansas gas service, said that if december's cold snap had continued into january, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""i was getting worried,"" he said. then suddenly the market turned when january's weather turned warmer. wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. among area utilities, kansas gas service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. and missouri gas energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin wednesday. sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. missouri gas energy has no hedging program. it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. on friday, doug micheel, senior counsel of the missouri office of the public counsel, said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy's gas purchasing practices. ""consumers are taking all the risk,"" micheel said. ""it's time to consider some changes."" to reach steve everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to severly@kcstar.com.",<27887069.1075855698863.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Mon, 22 Jan 2001 01:24:00 -0800 (PST",mike.grigsby@enron.com

"jeff, before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. there are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. what is an outside management firm going to do? a full time onsite manager is all that is required. as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. considering #1 & #2 $115,000 noi is not necessarily overstated. if you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. getting cash out is not a priority to me. so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. a 10% note actually attractive. see below. my job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. sales price 705,000 1st lien 473,500 2nd lien 225,000 transfer fee 7,500 cash required 14,500 noi 100,000 1st lien 47,292 2nd lien 23,694 cash flow 29,014 cash on cash 200% these numbers are using the conservative noi, if it comes in at $115k then cash on cash return would be more like 300%. this doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price. do you want to reconsider? let me know. phillip",<2754791.1075855698286.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Wed, 31 Jan 2001 08:20:00 -0800 (PST",Jeff Smith

"george, the probability of building a house this year is increasing. i have shifted to a slightly different plan. there were too many design items that i could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. now, i am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. one wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. the other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. this plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. i am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. the center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. i am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. i don't know if you can imagine the house i am trying to describe. i would like to come and visit you again this month. if it would work for you, i would like to drive up on sunday afternoon on feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. i would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for. i can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. call or email to let me know if this would work for you. pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work) phillip allen ps. channel 2 in houston ran a story yesterday (feb. 2) about a home in kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls. you should try their website or call the station to get the full story. it would makes a good case for breathable walls.",<8911790.1075855698187.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Fri, 2 Feb 2001 05:25:00 -0800 (PST",info@geoswan.co

"lucy, here is the rentroll for this friday. sorry it is so late. there are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 1. i know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. the missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 missed on 2/2? 5. #13 missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? my guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. you may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that i don't remember on some of these. i just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. will have some time today to work on a utility letter. tried to call wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him. will try again today. i believe that a doctor from seguin is going to make an offer. did you meet them? if so, what did you think? phillip",<27691386.1075855697832.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Thu, 8 Feb 2001 23:21:00 -0800 (PST",stagecoachmama@hotmail.co

"jaques, after meeting with george and larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%. there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. but i think the majority of it is profit. finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. keith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. after all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? we were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don't think the construction management fee is included. george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. i will review and let you know what i think. the gp issues don't seem to be a point of contention. they are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. let me know if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million. phillip",<7914119.1075855697335.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Tue, 20 Feb 2001 01:38:00 -0800 (PST",JacquesTC@aol.com @ ENRO

"jacques, i think we reached an agreement with george and larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time. it looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal). one point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied. i looked at the closing statements and i didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. can you help clear this up. assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. keith and i are concerned about taking over the bishop corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities. on the other hand, conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean. what is your inclination? call as soon as you have a chance to review. phillip",<33307764.1075855696139.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Fri, 16 Mar 2001 04:28:00 -0800 (PST",jacquestc@aol.co

"johnnie, thank you for meeting with me on friday. i left feeling very optimistic about the panel system. i would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design i showed you. in order to make it feasible within my budget i am sure it will take several iterations. the prospect of purchasing the panels and having your framers install them may have to be considered. however, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor. i realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale. i just want to assure you that i am going to build this house in the fall and i would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built. please email your cost estimates when complete. thank you, phillip allen",<3749063.1075855694831.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Mon, 23 Apr 2001 02:41:00 -0700 (PDT",johnniebrown@juno.co

"frank, the implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position. whatever the risk was prior should not matter. since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset. if the var calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted. phillip",<7018824.1075855694660.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Tue, 24 Apr 2001 05:08:00 -0700 (PDT",Frank Hayde

"ned, regarding the waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value. the following assumptions were made to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/mmbtu variable injection and withdrawal fees. also an undiscounted june 01 to january 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid. bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning june 01 based on above assumptions: $0.05/ mmbtu/month ($0.60/year). demand charges only. i am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not. please call or email with comments. phillip allen",<18154553.1075855694528.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Wed, 25 Apr 2001 08:57:00 -0700 (PDT",Ned Higgin

"traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. especially if you have to prepare a presentation. i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. as far as the business meetings, i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. my suggestion for where to go is austin. play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. flying somewhere takes too much time.",<24807826.1075855693979.JavaMail.evans@thyme,"Fri, 4 May 2001 01:51:00 -0700 (PDT",John J Lavorat

Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.
Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.

Bitcoin v0.1.2 is now available for download.
See http://www.bitcoin.org for the download link.
All the problems I've been finding are in the code that
automatically finds and connects to other nodes, since I wasn't
able to test it in the wild until now.  There are many more ways
for connections to get screwed up on the real Internet.
Bugs fixed:
- Fixed various problems that were making it hard for new nodes to
see other nodes to connect to.
- If you're behind a firewall, it could only receive one
connection, and the second connection would constantly disconnect
and reconnect.
These problems are kind of screwing up the network and will get
worse as more users arrive, so please make sure to upgrade.

It's fully operational and the network is growing.  If you try the

The next thing for v0.1.6 is to take advantage of multiple
processors to generate blocks.  Currently it only starts one
thread.  If you have a multi-core processor like a Core Duo or
Quad this will double or quadruple your production.
Later I want to add interfaces to make it really easy to integrate
into websites from any server side language.

"Thanks virtualcoin, that's a perfect comparison.The 8% speedup from 32-bit Windows (2310k) to 32-bit Linux (2500k) is probably from the newer version of GCC on Linux (4.4.3 vs 3.4.5).The 15% speedup from 32-bit to 64-bit Linux is more of a mystery.Â  The code is completely 32-bit.Hmm, I think the 8 extra registers added by x86-64 must be what's helping.Â  That would make a significant difference to SHA if it could hold most of the 16 state variables in registers.

"Quote from: knightmb on July 15, 2010, 07:37:10 PMOn Windows, the priority of the Coin Generation is still net for normal. If you run BitCoin in Generate Coin mode, then load up something to eat up all the CPU (like CPU hog for example:http://www.microtask.ca/cpuhog.html) you'll see that both BitCoin and CPU hog share the CPU 50/50 instead of CPU Hog taking all the CPU and BitCoin running only on idle/low process. The khash/s is also reduced in half, so further evidence that the threads are not running in a lower than normal prioirty.I was not able to reproduce this.Â  I have dual-proc, so I ran two memory hogs.Â  Bitcoin got 0% of CPU according to the task manager.Â  The khash/sec meter stayed stuck because it couldn't get any CPU to update it.Do you have dual-proc?Â  Are you sure you weren't running a single processor hog?

My problem is the version that is used (2.9), which is considered unstable by many distro packagers (although the WxWidgets devs say it isn't). On the other side, as far as I know WxWidgets uses gtk under Linux for drawing the whole stuff and makes it for the bitcoins devs easy to make things cross platform.wxWidgets 2.9 is their first UTF-8 version.Â  We are UTF-8 on all platforms including Windows.The distro packages of 2.8 are UTF-16, so they just trip people up.Â  People had endless build problems with 2.8 and its wxString UTF-16/ANSI conditional build options until we standardized on 2.9.Â  Also, to use 2.8, we were using ANSI, which was just a temporary stopgap until wxWidgets supported UTF-8.This is a problem that will solve itself.Â  With time, 2.9 will become a more mainline release.

"Double Spending
The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.

"Encryption
A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.

"Fees
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like. It's sent directly when it connects.

"Mining
By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.

"Nodes
Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one.

"Privacy
The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the ""tape"", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.

"Proof-of-Work
We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.

"Scalability
The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain.  In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification.  The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks.  It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself. 
The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed.  For now, everyone just runs a full network node.

"Transactions
We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced, and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.

I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully
peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.
The paper is available at:
http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
The main properties:
Double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.
No mint or other trusted parties.
Participants can be anonymous.
New coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work.
The proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the
network to prevent double-spending.
Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
Abstract.  A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would
allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another
without the burdens of going through a financial institution.
Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent
double-spending",0,emails,email,email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,7,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3,False,"[""What was Satoshi Nakamoto's view on preventing double-spending?"", 'Did the creation of a peer-to-peer network help prevent double-spending?', ""How does Hashcash style proof-of-work relate to Bitcoin's new coin generation?"", 'Is digital signature only part of the solution in preventing double-spending?', 'When was Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System first proposed?']"
".  We propose a solution to the double-spending
problem using a peer-to-peer network.  The network timestamps
transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based
proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
redoing the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as
proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came
from the largest pool of CPU power.  As long as honest nodes control
the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest
chain and outpace any attackers.  The network itself requires
minimal structure",1,emails,email,email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,7,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3,False,"['What did Satoshi Nakamoto propose to solve the double-spending problem?', 'How does the longest chain in the network provide proof of its origin?', 'Can honest nodes control the most CPU power on the network and outpace attackers?', 'Does Satoshi mention the role of hash-based proof-of-work in timestamping transactions?', 'Is the proposed solution minimal in terms of required network structure?']"
".  The network itself requires
minimal structure.  Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis,
and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the
longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they
were gone.

Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction",1,emails,email,email_008_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,8,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_008_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_008_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3,False,"['How bandwidth works for large numbers of transactions in Bitcoin, as described by Satoshi Nakamoto?', ""What fraction of the blockchain is needed to prevent double spending, according to Satoshi's estimates?"", 'At what point would most users be expected to run specialized hardware due to network growth?', ""Does Satoshi Nakamoto believe that high bandwidth is a significant issue for Bitcoin's scalability, and if so, why?"", 'How does satellite farms with server hardware relate to running nodes on the Bitcoin network', 'Is it possible for average users to prevent double spending without specialized node setup?']"
".  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

Thanks for bringing up that point.
I didn't really make that statement as strong as I could have.  The requirement is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single attacker.
There would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overpower the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.  The smaller farms are then the ""honest nodes""",0,emails,email,email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,9,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3,False,"['What does Satoshi Nakamoto believe is necessary for honest nodes to outpace attackers on the Bitcoin network?', 'How did Satoshi envision a balance between individual zombie farms and the collective power of honest nodes in maintaining security?', 'Was the requirement that good guys have more computational firepower than any single attacker a key limitation of hashcash, as mentioned by Satoshi?', 'Were there smaller, non-overwhelming zombie farms that could generate bitcoins without overpowering the network?', ""At what point do smaller zombie farms become considered 'honest nodes' in Satoshi's framework."", ""What was the original issue with hashcash making it unreliable on today's Internet, according to Satoshi?""]"
".  The smaller farms are then the ""honest nodes"".  (I need a better term than ""honest"")  The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.  According to the ""long tail"" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.
Even if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's instantly rich.  All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check.  To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back.  I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins",1,emails,email,email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,9,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3,False,"[""What does Satoshi Nakamoto refer to as the 'honest nodes' in the context of Bitcoin farms?"", ""How would an attacker who overpowers the network benefit from it, according to Satoshi's theory?"", ""According to the 'long tail' theory, what effect might smaller farms have on the overall strength of the Bitcoin network?""]"
".  With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.
The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead.

Increasing hardware speed is handled: ""To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.""
As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to creating bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the total new production constant",0,emails,email,email_011_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,11,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_011_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_011_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,2,False,"[""What was Satoshi's view on inflation in Bitcoin?"", 'How does the proof-of-work difficulty adjustment impact the rate of new bitcoin production?', 'In what year did Satoshi Nakamoto first mention a concern about increasing computational power affecting the bitcoin mining process?', 'Is there a fixed total capacity for new bitcoin creation?', 'Will the annual increase in computer speed remain constant indefinitely?']"
".  Thus, it is known in advance how many new bitcoins will be created every year in the future.
The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation.  If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable.  If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value increase.
Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.

That does not need to be checked for.  The transaction in whichever branch ends up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid.  If someone tries to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the others invalid.
Receivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved",1,emails,email,email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,12,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,7,False,"['Did chain management prevent the double-spending of coins in an alternate Bitcoin protocol?', 'Under what conditions would a new block be invalid and another, with a higher probability?', 'Why was double spending never truly prevented in this situation?', 'What is the basis for choosing one spend as valid over others from multiple chains?', 'Was any consideration given to mitigating situations where different nodes might hear about two conflicting transactions with the same coin?']"

The attacker isn't adding blocks to the end",2,emails,email,email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,12,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,7,False,"['How did Satoshi Nakamoto address the issue of double-spending in Bitcoin?', 'What led Satoshi to question consistency checks in nodes for transaction integrity?', ""Did Satoshi's view on attacking the longest chain imply concerns about an attacker's ability to erase or add transactions?""]"
".  He has to go back and redo the block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he's doing that.  He's rewriting history.  Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.
This touches on a key point.  Even though everyone present may see the shenanigans going on, there's no way to take advantage of that fact.
It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this.  We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.

The recipient just needs to verify it back to a depth that is sufficiently far back in the block chain, which will often only require a depth of 2 transactions.  All transactions before that can be discarded.

I appreciate your questions.  I actually did this kind of backwards.  I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.  I think I will be able to release the code sooner than I could write a detailed spec.  You're already right about most of your assumptions where you filled in the blanks.

The proof-of-work chain is the solution to the synchronisation problem, and to knowing what the globally shared view is without having to trust anyone.
A transaction will quickly propagate throughout the network, so if two versions of the same transaction were reported at close to the same time, the one with the head start would have a big advantage in reaching many more nodes first",1,emails,email,email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,13,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4,False,"['What did Satoshi Nakamoto say about peer-to-peer networks?', 'Does the Bitcoin development rely on a globally shared view of all past transactions?']"
".  Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one to arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working on incorporating it into the next proof-of-work.  In effect, each node votes for its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its proof-of-work effort.
If the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an even split, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that decides which is valid.
When a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated throughout the network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the next block after it.  Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to include it in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.
The proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from the globally shared view",2,emails,email,email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,13,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4,False,"['How do nodes prioritize transactions in the Bitcoin network?', 'What is the purpose of a proof-of-work effort in this context?', 'Does Satoshi Nakamoto explain how the global shared view is represented in the chain?']"
".  Only the majority of the network together has enough CPU power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work.  Any user, upon receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the network has approved.  Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links back in the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.

They both broadcast their blocks.  All nodes receive them and keep both, but only work on the one they received first.  We'll suppose exactly half received one first, half the other.
In a short time, all the transactions will finish propagating so that everyone has the full set.

".  Whichever side it is, the new block will contain the other half of the transactions, so in either case, the branch will contain all transactions.  Even in the unlikely event that a split happened twice in a row, both sides of the second split would contain the full set of transactions anyway.
It's not a problem if transactions have to wait one or a few extra cycles to get into a block.

If you're having trouble with the inflation issue, it's easy to tweak it for transaction fees instead.

When there are multiple double-spent versions of the same transaction, one and only one will become valid.
The receiver of a payment must wait an hour or so before believing that it's valid.  The network will resolve any possible double-spend races by then.

Every block includes its creation time.  If the time is off by more than 36 hours, other nodes won't work on it.

The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem.  I'll try to rephrase it in that context.
A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble",0,emails,email,email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,17,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4,False,"[""What was Satoshi Nakamoto's understanding of the trust problem in distributed systems?"", ""Did Satoshi believe that a proof-of-work system would solve the Byzantine Generals' Problem."", ""According to James A. Donald, what specific challenge did the Byzantine Generals' Problem present for Satoshi's proof-of-work chain?"", ""Was the key concept of brute forcing the password relevant to Satoshi's solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem?""]"
".  They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.
They don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree.  It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.
They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem.  Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution",1,emails,email,email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,17,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4,False,"['What prompted Satoshi Nakamoto and his group of miners to work together on a blockchain-based solution?', 'How did the lack of real-time communication among miners impact their ability to coordinate an attack?', 'When was the first peer-to-peer network formed and how did it lead to the development of Bitcoin?', ""Did Satoshi Nakamoto believe that the proof-of-work system would be sufficient to secure a majority of the network's nodes?"", ""At what point did Satoshi decide on a specific time for the group's mining effort, despite the lack of a coordinated schedule."", ""How did the network's latency affect the timing of the attack, and how was it resolved?"", ""Would the decentralized nature of Bitcoin's early development make it vulnerable to targeted attacks by single entities?""]"

If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.
After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work.  Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.

".  They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.

Fortunately, it's only necessary to keep a pending-transaction pool for the current best branch.  When a new block arrives for the best branch, ConnectBlock removes the block's transactions from the pending-tx pool.  If a different branch becomes longer, it calls DisconnectBlock on the main branch down to the fork, returning the block transactions to the pending-tx pool, and calls ConnectBlock on the new branch, sopping back up any transactions that were in both branches.  It's expected that reorgs like this would be rare and shallow.

Broadcasts will probably be almost completely reliable.  TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days, and the broadcast protocol has a retry mechanism to get the data from other nodes after a while.  If broadcasts turn out to be slower in practice than expected, the target time between blocks may have to be increased to avoid wasting resources.  We want blocks to usually propagate in much less time than it takes to generate them, otherwise nodes would spend too much time working on obsolete blocks.
I'm planning to run an automated test with computers randomly sending payments to each other and randomly dropping packets.

If you're thinking of it as a CPU-intensive digital signing, then you may be thinking of a race to finish a long operation first and the fastest always winning.
The proof-of-work is a Hashcash style SHA-256 collision finding.  It's a memoryless process where you do millions of hashes a second, with a small chance of finding one each time",4,emails,email,email_019_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,19,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_019_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_019_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,7,False,"[""Does Satoshi Nakamoto's idea of refreshing transaction records have any implication on the fairness and scalability of the Bitcoin network?"", 'Is there a specific mechanism for nodes to contribute more evenly to the creation and maintenance of the blockchain?', 'Is the SHA-256 proof-of-work finding process memory-dependent or does it depend solely on computational resources?', ""How does Satoshi's concept of a partially pre-image zero hash relate to traditional notions of digital signatures in computer science?"", 'Can nodes without access to the three fastest miners still participate in the broadcast transaction record and have their transactions added to the chain?']"
".  The 3 or 4 fastest nodes' dominance would only be proportional to their share of the total CPU power.  Anyone's chance of finding a solution at any time is proportional to their CPU power.
There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can.  Nodes will eventually be compensated by transaction fees alone when the total coins created hits the pre-determined ceiling.

Right, it's ECC digital signatures.  A new key pair is used for every
transaction.
It's not pseudonymous in the sense of nyms identifying people, but it
is at least a little pseudonymous in that the next action on a coin
can be identified as being from the owner of that coin.

Section 11 calculates the worst case under attack.  Typically, 5 or
10 blocks is enough for that.  If you're selling something that
doesn't merit a network-scale attack to steal it, in practice you
could cut it closer.

This is a version 2 problem that I believe can be solved fairly
satisfactorily for most applications.
The race is to spread your transaction on the network first.  Think 6
degrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially",2,emails,email,email_020_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,20,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_020_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_020_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,5,False,"[""What is a key challenge in Bitcoin's transaction processing that Satoshi identified as a problem?"", 'How many blocks does the sender and the network need to wait for transactions to be confirmed as valid?', 'Did Satoshi see peer-to-peer networks as inherently prone to double-spending issues?', 'Can merchants verify whether a spent Bitcoin is invalid without waiting on additional confirmations?', 'How do consumers balance their desire to quickly spend their coins with the risk of being caught out in case of an invalid transaction?']"
".  Think 6
degrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially.  It would only take
something like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough
that a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing
very many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.
During those 2 minutes, the merchant's nodes can be watching for a
double-spent transaction.  The double-spender would not be able to
blast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant
getting it, so he has to wait before starting.
If the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches
10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90%
chance his money gets spent.  For almost any type of goods, that's
not going to be worth it for the scammer.
Information based goods like access to website or downloads are
non-fencible.  Nobody is going to be able to make a living off
stealing access to websites or downloads",3,emails,email,email_020_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,20,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_020_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_020_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,5,False,"['How does the time complexity of a peer-to-peer network impact its scalability?', ""What was Satoshi's justification for claiming that competitors starting late would have little chance of grabbing many nodes before being overtaken?"", 'In what specific percentage thresholds did a double-spender have to meet in order to risk losing their transaction?']"
".  Nobody is going to be able to make a living off
stealing access to websites or downloads.  They can go to the file
sharing networks to steal that.  Most instant-access products aren't
going to have a huge incentive to steal.
If a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the
customer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many
already do.  If they really want to optimize, and it's a large
download, they could cancel the download in the middle if the
transaction comes back double-spent.  If it's website access,
typically it wouldn't be a big deal to let the customer have access
for 5 minutes and then cut off access if it's rejected.  Many such
sites have a free trial anyway.

I think I've got the peer networking broadcast mechanism covered.
Each node sends its neighbours an inventory list of hashes of the
new blocks and transactions it has.  The neighbours request the
items they don't have yet.  If the item never comes through after a
timeout, they request it from another neighbour that had it",1,emails,email,email_021_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,21,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_021_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_021_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4,False,"['What did Satoshi Nakamoto say about reliability of broadcasts in peer-to-peer networks?', 'How does the system handle information that frequently fails to arrive?', 'Does Satoshi mention a specific mechanism for handling failures that would prevent double-spending of coins?']"
".  Since
all or most of the neighbours should eventually have each item,
even if the coms get fumbled up with one, they can get it from any
of the others, trying one at a time.
The inventory-request-data scheme introduces a little latency, but
it ultimately helps speed more by keeping extra data blocks off the
transmit queues and conserving bandwidth.

connection issues.  0.1.3 fixed a problem where your node's
communications could go dead after a while.  The network is
running much more smoothly now with this version.
If you've successfully generated a block, you've seen it has a
maturation countdown before you can spend it.  Once it matures,
the Credit column will change from 0.00 to 50.00.  For a block to
be valid, it has to be broadcasted to the network and get into the
block chain, which is why Generate does not run if you're not
connected.  If you generated a block without being connected, the
network wouldn't know about it and would continue building the
chain without it, leaving it behind, and the maturation countdown
would change to ""(not accepted)"" when your node sees that it
wasn't used",0,emails,email,email_026_[bitcoin-list]_Bitcoin_v0.1.3,26,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_026_[bitcoin-list]_Bitcoin_v0.1.3.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_026_[bitcoin-list]_Bitcoin_v0.1.3.html,[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.3,2,False,"['How does the credit column change its value after block maturation?', ""Did Satoshi Nakamoto mention a reason why Generate doesn't run if you're not connected to the network?"", 'What was the solution to the Internet connection issue problem described by Satoshi', 'Does the maturation countdown change when a block is successfully generated but not broadcasted?', 'What is a condition for a block to be considered valid in the Bitcoin network?']"

Another factor that would mitigate spam if POW tokens have value:
there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive
quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from
spam",0,emails,email,email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released,29,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released.html,Bitcoin v0.1 released,3,False,"['What were some potential security risks associated with POW tokens in Bitcoin?', 'Did Satoshi Nakamoto believe that the value of POW tokens could lead to more vigilant users cleaning their computers?', 'In what year and on which date was a substantial quantity of POW tokens created?', 'Was Satoshi concerned about machines being able to perform tasks maliciously if POW tokens had great value?', 'Could the possibility of POW tokens having valuable worth help to stop spam?']"
".  They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the
message.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become
too high for spam to be cost effective.
The process has the potential to establish the POW token's value
in the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could
buy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would
temporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the
self-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the
spammers.
Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of
spam called ""dusting""",1,emails,email,email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released,29,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released.html,Bitcoin v0.1 released,3,False,"[""What is the concept of 'reverse-spamming' in the context of Bitcoin's POW token?"", 'Did Satoshi Nakamoto suggest buying back tokens to establish its value in combating spam?', ""In what way did the concept of 'dusting', similar to the POE method used by e-gold, relate to Bitcoin's early days?""]"
".  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust
in order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.
If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're
willing to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a
message with it, users could set how much they're willing to get
paid to receive spam.

I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin.  It's
completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties,
because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.  Give it a
try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:
Download Bitcoin v0.1 at
http://www.bitcoin.org
The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's
required to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to
debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of
breaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and
transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit
bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve",0,emails,email,email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency,32,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency,4,False,"['What did Satoshi Nakamoto say about the trust required for conventional currency?', ""Did Bitcoin's use of crypto proof replace trust in a P2P system?"", 'Who or what is credited with being trusted not to debase fiat currencies?']"
".  We have to trust them with
our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.
Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.
A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar
problem.  Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password
protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system
administrator to keep their information private.  Privacy could always
be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the
principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his
superiors.  Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and
trust was no longer required.  Data could be secured in a way that was
physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason,
no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.
It's time we had the same thing for money",1,emails,email,email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency,32,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency,4,False,"['What did Satoshi Nakamoto say about micropayments?', 'Why did Satoshi mention the need for strong encryption for securing files?', 'Did Satoshi believe that trust was required to secure accounts in the early days of multi-user time-sharing computer systems?']"
".  With e-currency based on
cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman,
money can be secure and transactions effortless.
One of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital
signatures.  A digital coin contains the public key of its owner.  To
transfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of
the next owner.  Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of
ownership.  It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big
problem unsolved: double-spending.  Any owner could try to re-spend an
already spent coin by signing it again to another owner.  The usual
solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for
double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model.  In its
central position, the company can override the users, and the fees
needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.
Bitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for
double-spending",2,emails,email,email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency,32,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency,4,False,"['What did Satoshi Nakamoto say about digital signatures?', ""Who overcomes the problem of double-spending with a trusted company database in Bitcoin's initial design?"", ""Is micropayment impractical due to fees needed to support a central database in Bitcoin's early implementation?"", 'Does Satoshi view peer-to-peer networks as a solution to checking for double-spending transactions?', ']']"
".  In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed
timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin.  It
takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but
hard to stifle.  For details on how it works, see the design paper at
http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
The result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.
Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with
each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.

It's similar in that it uses digital signatures for coins, but different
in the approach to privacy and preventing double-spending.  The
recipient of a Bitcoin payment is able to check whether it is the first
spend or not, and second-spends are not accepted.  There isn't an
off-line mode where double-spenders are caught and shamed after the
fact, because that would require participants to have identities.

every transaction",0,emails,email,email_033_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency,33,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_033_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_033_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency,2,False,"['How did Satoshi Nakamoto prevent double-spending in Bitcoin?', ""What distinguishes David Chaum's anonymous digital money from the approach used in Bitcoin?"", ""Did Satoshi use a method similar to David Chaum's concept without an off-line mode to catch double-spenders?"", 'Is key pair usage for privacy and transaction uniqueness unique to Bitcoin?', 'Was the recipient of a Bitcoin payment able to verify if it was their first spend?']"

Of course, the biggest difference is the lack of a central server.  That
was the Achilles heel of Chaumian systems; when the central company shut
down, so did the currency.

Indeed, it is much like Pekunio in the concept of spraying redundant
copies of every transaction to a number of peers on the network, but the
implementation is not a reputation network like Wizard Rabbit Treasurer.
In fact, Bitcoin does not use reputation at all.  It sees the network
as just a big crowd and doesn't much care who it talks to or who tells
it something, as long as at least one of them relays the information
being broadcast around the network.  It doesn't care because there's no

network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4

The current version will work fine.  They'll each connect over the
Internet, while incoming connections only come to the host that
port 8333 is routed to.
As an optimisation, I'll make a switch ""-connect=1.2.3.4"" to make
it only connect to a specific address.  You could make your extra
nodes connect to your primary, and only the primary connects over
the Internet.  It doesn't really matter for now, since the network
would have to get huge before the bandwidth is anything more than
trivial.

Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for
transactions.  A few lines of code could create a transaction with
an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.
I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.

". Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.It's time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.One of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital signatures.

The usual solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model. In its central position, the company can override the users, and the fees needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.Bitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for double-spending.

Generating coins successfully requires constant connectivity, so that you can start working on the next block when someone gets the current block before you.

Right now you have the server (server TCP socket) send the handshake. My reasons for this are anonymity of course. It is far too easy for ISPs to portscan clients and detect they are running this program.That's a good idea. Â The side accepting the connection just needs to withhold from sending anything until it receives a valid handshake. Â Any portscan would only get a dead connection that doesn't volunteer to identify itself.Quote- Use some sort of encryption during the handshake (sort of goes with the statement/request above) to obfuscate what the software is during DPI (deep packet inspection).

Â Maybe a better more immediate solution is to connect through TOR, which will be possible with 0.2.Quote- Some sort of an API is needed so that this system can be integrated with websites to provide instant-on services. A simple https receipt mechanism would do wonders. Have the client post each incoming payment to an https url with all of the relevant information and provide status updates. Also an outbound payment mechanism would be nice. So one could automate payments (and batch payments) outbound. Status could be returned via the https receipt interface.That's one of the main things on the agenda after 0.2.Quote- Static port/Random port. Have a setting to randomly assign the port that it runs on. (also be able to set it statically for very restrictive firewalls).Yeah, the other stealth stuff would be kinda pointless if it's always the same port number.Quote- UPnP support",1,posts,post,post_018_Re__A_few_suggestions,18,nakamotoinstitute_files\posts\post_018_Re__A_few_suggestions.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\posts\post_018_Re__A_few_suggestions.html,Re  A few suggestions,3,False,"[""How does Satoshi Nakamoto's mention of connecting through TOR relate to his concerns about DPI?"", ""What is the significance of UPnP support in Bitcoin's development?"", 'Did Satoshi suggest using APIs for instant-on services in Bitcoin?', 'At what version (0.2) did Satoshi propose implementing a random port setting for improved stealth?', 'Why does Satoshi mention that an API would be necessary to integrate Bitcoin with websites?']"

Perhaps with a telnet-able port for control (or even a unix socket would be ok).I'm still thinking about how best to structure the management interface.

Â It's not necessary to poll very frequently. Â If you require 1 confirmation, that'll take an average of 10 minutes anyway, so there's no point in polling more often than every few minutes.If you're selling digital goods and services, where you don't lose much if someone gets a free access, and it can't be resold for profit, I think you're fine to accept 0 confirmations.It's mostly only if you were selling gold or currency that you'd need multiple confirmations.

I can remember one message about transaction fee where the string is split in two to insert the fee value, where you could simply have put a %s. It makes the message harder to translate as I had to go in the source to find exactly what was going on.- Some strings have whitespace at the end or start, which necessity is very debatable, and it's easy to miss in PoEdit.Many of the strings are in code automatically generated from uiproject.fbp where nothing can be done about these things.Â  I have a program I use to find all the spacing inconsistencies at the beginning and ending of strings in your .po file and manually fix them up before I upload them to SVN.

"Here's an outline of the kind of escrow transaction that's possible in software. Â This is not implemented and I probably won't have time to implement it soon, but just to let you know what's possible.The basic escrow: The buyer commits a payment to escrow. The seller receives a transaction with the money in escrow, but he can't spend it until the buyer unlocks it. The buyer can release the payment at any time after that, which could be never. This does not allow the buyer to take the money back, but it does give him the option to burn the money out of spite by never releasing it. The seller has the option to release the money back to the buyer.While this system does not guarantee the parties against loss, it takes the profit out of cheating.If the seller doesn't send the goods, he doesn't get paid. The buyer would still be out the money, but at least the seller has no monetary motivation to stiff him.The buyer can't benefit by failing to pay. He can't get the escrow money back",0,posts,post,post_332_Escrow,332,nakamotoinstitute_files\posts\post_332_Escrow.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\posts\post_332_Escrow.html,Escrow,2,False,"['What is the basic escrow transaction in Bitcoin?', ""Why does Satoshi mention that the buyer can't benefit by failing to pay in an escrow transaction?"", 'How much time did Satoshi leave for the buyer to release their payment in a simple escrow system?', ""Yes, did Satoshi implement the escrow transaction in Bitcoin's software?"", 'What is the motivation behind using this kind of escrow system in Bitcoin?', 'When will be the time for implementing the seller receive-only end-of the-year escrow?', 'How does the escrow transaction affect the profit in a cheating-seller scenario?']"
". He can't get the escrow money back. He can't fail to pay due to lack of funds. The seller can see that the funds are committed to his key and can't be sent to anyone else.Now, an economist would say that a fraudulent seller could start negotiating, such as ""release the money and I'll give you half of it back"", but at that point, there would be so little trust and so much spite that negotiation is unlikely. Why on earth would the fraudster keep his word and send you half if he's already breaking his word to steal it? I think for modest amounts, almost everyone would refuse on principle alone.

"Quote from: nanotube on December 09, 2010, 09:20:40 PMseems that the miner would have to basically do ""extra work"". and if there's no reward from the bitdns mining from the extra work (which of course, slows down the main bitcoin work), what would be a miner's incentive to include bitdns (and whatever other side chains) ?The incentive is to get the rewards from the extra side chains also for the same work.While you are generating bitcoins, why not also get free domain names for thesame work?If you currently generate 50 BTC per week, now you could get 50 BTC and some domain names too.You have one piece of work. Â If you solve it, it will solve a block from both Bitcoin and BitDNS. Â In concept, they're tied together by a Merkle Tree. Â To hand it in to Bitcoin, you break off the BitDNS branch, and to hand it in to BitDNS, you break off the Bitcoin branch.In practice, to retrofit it for Bitcoin, the BitDNS side would have to have maybe ~200 extra bytes, but that's not a big deal",0,posts,post,post_536_Re__BitDNS_and_Generalizing_Bitcoin,536,nakamotoinstitute_files\posts\post_536_Re__BitDNS_and_Generalizing_Bitcoin.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\posts\post_536_Re__BitDNS_and_Generalizing_Bitcoin.html,Re  BitDNS and Generalizing Bitcoin,2,False,"['What did Satoshi Nakamoto say was a problem with including BitDNS in Bitcoin mining?', ""Why might miner's reward include side chains like BitDNS?"", 'Was the additional space required to link to BitDNS insignificant?']"
". Â You've been talking about 50 domains per block, which would dwarf that little 200 bytes per block for backward compatibility. Â We could potentially schedule a far in future block when Bitcoin would upgrade to a modernised arrangement with the Merkle Tree on top, if we care enough about saving a few bytes.Note that the chains are below this new Merkle Tree. Â That is, each of Bitcoin and BitDNS have their own chain links inside their blocks. Â This is inverted from the common timestamp server arrangement, where the chain is on top and then the Merkle Tree, because that creates one common master chain. Â This is two timestamp servers not sharing a chain.

"Not locktime.There's a possible design for far in the future:You intentionally write a double-spend. Â You write it with the same inputs and outputs, but this time with a fee. Â When your double-spend gets into a block, the first spend becomes invalid. Â The payee does not really notice, because at the moment the new transaction becomes valid, the old one becomes invalid, and the new transaction simply takes its place.It's easier said than implemented. Â There would be a fair amount of work to make a client that correctly writes the double-spend, manages the two versions in the wallet until one is chosen, handles all the corner cases. Â Every assumption in the existing code is that you're not trying to write double-spends.There would need to be some changes on the Bitcoin Miner side also, to make the possibility to accept a double-spend into the transaction pool, but only strictly if the inputs and outputs match and the transaction fee is higher",0,posts,post,post_537_Re__Fees_in_BitDNS_confusion,537,nakamotoinstitute_files\posts\post_537_Re__Fees_in_BitDNS_confusion.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\posts\post_537_Re__Fees_in_BitDNS_confusion.html,Re  Fees in BitDNS confusion,2,False,"['What is the purpose of a double-spend in Bitcoin transactions?', 'How would a client handle a double-spend scenario with conflicting versions?', 'Did Satoshi Nakamoto propose implementing a new protocol to accommodate double-spends in the future?

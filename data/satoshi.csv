Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.
Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.

Bitcoin v0.1.2 is now available for download.
See http://www.bitcoin.org for the download link.
All the problems I've been finding are in the code that
automatically finds and connects to other nodes, since I wasn't
able to test it in the wild until now.  There are many more ways
for connections to get screwed up on the real Internet.
Bugs fixed:
- Fixed various problems that were making it hard for new nodes to
see other nodes to connect to.
- If you're behind a firewall, it could only receive one
connection, and the second connection would constantly disconnect
and reconnect.
These problems are kind of screwing up the network and will get
worse as more users arrive, so please make sure to upgrade.

It's fully operational and the network is growing.  If you try the
software, e-mail me your Bitcoin address and I'll send you a few coins.
We just need to spread the word and keep getting more people interested.

The next thing for v0.1.6 is to take advantage of multiple
processors to generate blocks.  Currently it only starts one
thread.  If you have a multi-core processor like a Core Duo or
Quad this will double or quadruple your production.
Later I want to add interfaces to make it really easy to integrate
into websites from any server side language.

Maybe they would be interested in going in a new direction.A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.

"When there's enough scale, maybe there can be an exchange site that doesn't do transfers, just matches up buyers and sellers to exchange with each other directly, similar to how e-bay works.To make it safer, the exchange site could act as an escrow for the bitcoin side of the payment. Â The seller puts the bitcoin payment in escrow, and the buyer sends the conventional payment directly to the seller.

"That's a good idea.Â  I'm not sure where exactly to fit that in, but it could certainly calculate the expected average time between blocks generated, and then people would know what to expect.Every node and each processor has a different public key in its block, so they're guaranteed to be scanning different territory.Whenever the 32-bit nonce starts over at 1, bnExtraNonce gets incremented, which is an arbitrary precision integer.

"Quote from: theymos on June 05, 2010, 04:26:09 PMAdding transactions to the block you're working on will slow down your generation rateThe premise is false.Â  Adding more transactions to the block you're working on does NOT slow down your generation rate.Â  When generate is scanning hashes, it only hashes the header of the block, which is constant size.Â  The header contains a hash of the transactions (the Merkle root) and is only updated occasionally.If necessary I can write code to make nodes prefer not to use a block if it doesn't contain enough of the transactions they know about.Â  A discouraged block would almost always fail to be included in the main chain, but would be accepted if it did get in.Â  I doubt this will be necessary, since there's no real advantage for nodes not to include all transactions.

"Quote from: lachesis on July 25, 2010, 07:52:35 PMI found what appears to be a bug: with a long enough username and password combination, the base64 encoder in bitcoind produces authorization headers that look like this:Code:...Authorization: Basic YWJiYWJiYWFiYmE6aGVsbG93b3JsZGhlbGxvd29ybGRoZWxsb3dvcmxkaGVsbG93b3JsZGhlbGxvd29ybGRoZWxsb3dvcmxkIt inserts a newline every 64 characters, which obviously breaks the Authorization header, so commands like ""bitcoin getinfo"" fail. The server still works fine with properly behaving clients.This can be solved by removing the newlines (and maybe '
's) from result at the end of the Base64Encode function:Code:result.erase(std::remove(result.begin(), result.end(), '
'), result.end());result.erase(std::remove(result.begin(), result.end(), '

"True, there would probably be someone with a dial-up modem or satellite dish internet.Â  Rarer would be someone who has both that and the wired internet that has the outage, but if it's a big enough segment to matter, out of a million people there's bound to be a multi-home geek.ISP network cuts are just your local area. Â If you still have communication with the rest of your area, it would probably be something like 1/1000 of the world or less. Â Block generation in the segment would take several hours per block.I favour the plan to monitor if the frequency of blocks received drops too slow. Â That covers a large range of possibilities.

On the other side, as far as I know WxWidgets uses gtk under Linux for drawing the whole stuff and makes it for the bitcoins devs easy to make things cross platform.wxWidgets 2.9 is their first UTF-8 version.Â  We are UTF-8 on all platforms including Windows.The distro packages of 2.8 are UTF-16, so they just trip people up.Â  People had endless build problems with 2.8 and its wxString UTF-16/ANSI conditional build options until we standardized on 2.9.Â  Also, to use 2.8, we were using ANSI, which was just a temporary stopgap until wxWidgets supported UTF-8.This is a problem that will solve itself.Â  With time, 2.9 will become a more mainline release.

"Thank you for limiting flood tests to the testnet.Version 0.3.15 combines several features to help legitimate transactions jump the queue during a flood attack.Â  The key was Gavin's idea for prioritising transactions based on the age of their dependencies.Â  Every coin is entitled to turn over so often.Â  The longer waited, the more priority accumulates.Â  Priority is sum(valuein * age) / txsize.Â  Transaction fee still takes precedence over priority, and priority determines the order of processing within a fee strata.In support of the priority feature, SelectCoins only uses your own 0 conf transactions only as a last resort if that's all you have left.Â  This helps keep you from turning your coins over rapidly unless you're forcing it by actually turning all your coins over rapidly.

The reason for doing this is so as not to water down CPU power into multiple networks. We want one strong network, so the network should be versatile.Avoiding CPU power fragmentation is no longer a reason. Â Independent networks/chains can share CPU power without sharing much else.

As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.

"Bitcoin Design
We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power.

"Bitcoin Economics
The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.

"Double Spending
The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.

"Encryption
A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.

"Fees
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.

"Mining
By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.

Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one.

"Privacy
The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the ""tape"", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.

"Proof-of-Work
We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.

The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed.  For now, everyone just runs a full network node.

"Transactions
We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced, and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.

I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully

Double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.
No mint or other trusted parties.

New coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work.
The proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
Abstract.  A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would
allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another
without the burdens of going through a financial institution.
Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent
double-spending",0,emails,email,email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,007,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3
".  We propose a solution to the double-spending
problem using a peer-to-peer network.  The network timestamps
transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based
proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
redoing the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as
proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came
from the largest pool of CPU power.  As long as honest nodes control
the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest
chain and outpace any attackers.  The network itself requires
minimal structure",1,emails,email,email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,007,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_007_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3
".  The network itself requires
minimal structure.  Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis,
and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the
longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they
were gone.

Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction",1,emails,email,email_008_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,008,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_008_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_008_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3
".  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

Thanks for bringing up that point.
I didn't really make that statement as strong as I could have.  The requirement is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single attacker.
There would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overpower the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.  The smaller farms are then the ""honest nodes""",0,emails,email,email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,009,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3
".  The smaller farms are then the ""honest nodes"".  (I need a better term than ""honest"")  The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.  According to the ""long tail"" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.
Even if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's instantly rich.  All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check.  To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back.  I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins",1,emails,email,email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,009,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_009_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3
".  With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.
The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead.

Increasing hardware speed is handled: ""To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.""
As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to creating bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the total new production constant",0,emails,email,email_011_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,011,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_011_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_011_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,2
".  Thus, it is known in advance how many new bitcoins will be created every year in the future.
The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation.  If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable.  If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value increase.
Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.

That does not need to be checked for.  The transaction in whichever branch ends up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid.  If someone tries to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become valid, the others invalid.
Receivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for perhaps an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be resolved",1,emails,email,email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,012,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,7

The attacker isn't adding blocks to the end",2,emails,email,email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,012,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,7
".  He has to go back and redo the block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any new blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he's doing that.  He's rewriting history.  Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid one.
This touches on a key point.  Even though everyone present may see the shenanigans going on, there's no way to take advantage of that fact.
It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this.  We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.  The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say",3,emails,email,email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,012,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_012_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,7

The recipient just needs to verify it back to a depth that is sufficiently far back in the block chain, which will often only require a depth of 2 transactions.  All transactions before that can be discarded.

I appreciate your questions.  I actually did this kind of backwards.  I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.  I think I will be able to release the code sooner than I could write a detailed spec.  You're already right about most of your assumptions where you filled in the blanks.

The proof-of-work chain is the solution to the synchronisation problem, and to knowing what the globally shared view is without having to trust anyone.
A transaction will quickly propagate throughout the network, so if two versions of the same transaction were reported at close to the same time, the one with the head start would have a big advantage in reaching many more nodes first",1,emails,email,email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,013,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4
".  Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one to arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working on incorporating it into the next proof-of-work.  In effect, each node votes for its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its proof-of-work effort.
If the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an even split, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that decides which is valid.
When a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated throughout the network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the next block after it.  Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to include it in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.
The proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from the globally shared view",2,emails,email,email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,013,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_013_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4
".  Only the majority of the network together has enough CPU power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work.  Any user, upon receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the network has approved.  Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links back in the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.

They both broadcast their blocks.  All nodes receive them and keep both, but only work on the one they received first.  We'll suppose exactly half received one first, half the other.
In a short time, all the transactions will finish propagating so that everyone has the full set.  The nodes working on each side will be trying to add the transactions that are missing from their side.  When the next proof-of-work is found, whichever previous block that node was working on, that branch becomes longer and the tie is broken",0,emails,email,email_014_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,014,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_014_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_014_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,2
".  Whichever side it is, the new block will contain the other half of the transactions, so in either case, the branch will contain all transactions.  Even in the unlikely event that a split happened twice in a row, both sides of the second split would contain the full set of transactions anyway.
It's not a problem if transactions have to wait one or a few extra cycles to get into a block.

If you're having trouble with the inflation issue, it's easy to tweak it for transaction fees instead.  It's as simple as this: let the output value from any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value.  Either the client software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side",0,emails,email,email_015_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,015,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_015_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_015_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,2

When there are multiple double-spent versions of the same transaction, one and only one will become valid.
The receiver of a payment must wait an hour or so before believing that it's valid.  The network will resolve any possible double-spend races by then.

Sorry if I didn't make that clear.  The target time between blocks will probably be 10 minutes.
Every block includes its creation time.  If the time is off by more than 36 hours, other nodes won't work on it.

The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem.  I'll try to rephrase it in that context.
A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble",0,emails,email,email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,017,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4
".  They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.
They don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they all agree.  It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.
They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem.  Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution",1,emails,email,email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,017,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4
".  Once one of the generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work in the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.
After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work.  Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.  They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it",2,emails,email,email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,017,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_017_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,4
".  They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.
The proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed database and global view problems you've asked about are solved.

Fortunately, it's only necessary to keep a pending-transaction pool for the current best branch.  When a new block arrives for the best branch, ConnectBlock removes the block's transactions from the pending-tx pool.  If a different branch becomes longer, it calls DisconnectBlock on the main branch down to the fork, returning the block transactions to the pending-tx pool, and calls ConnectBlock on the new branch, sopping back up any transactions that were in both branches.  It's expected that reorgs like this would be rare and shallow.
With this optimisation, candidate branches are not really any burden",0,emails,email,email_018_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,018,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_018_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_018_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,3

Broadcasts will probably be almost completely reliable.  TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days, and the broadcast protocol has a retry mechanism to get the data from other nodes after a while.  If broadcasts turn out to be slower in practice than expected, the target time between blocks may have to be increased to avoid wasting resources.  We want blocks to usually propagate in much less time than it takes to generate them, otherwise nodes would spend too much time working on obsolete blocks.
I'm planning to run an automated test with computers randomly sending payments to each other and randomly dropping packets.

There's no need for reporting of ""proof of double spending"" like that.  If the same chain contains both spends, then the block is invalid and rejected.
Same if a block didn't have enough proof-of-work.  That block is invalid and rejected",1,emails,email,email_019_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper,019,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_019_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_019_Bitcoin_P2P_e-cash_paper.html,Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper,7

If there are two competing chains, each containing a different version of the same transaction, with one trying to give money to one person and the other trying to give the same money to someone else, resolving which of the spends is valid is what the whole proof-of-work chain is about.
We're not ""on the lookout"" for double spends to sound the alarm and catch the cheater.  We merely adjudicate which one of the spends is valid.

Right, it's ECC digital signatures.  A new key pair is used for every
transaction.

satisfactorily for most applications.

".  Think 6
degrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially.  It would only take
something like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough
that a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing
very many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.
During those 2 minutes, the merchant's nodes can be watching for a
double-spent transaction.  The double-spender would not be able to
blast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant
getting it, so he has to wait before starting.
If the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches
10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90%
chance his money gets spent.  For almost any type of goods, that's
not going to be worth it for the scammer.

If a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the
customer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many
already do.  If they really want to optimize, and it's a large
download, they could cancel the download in the middle if the
transaction comes back double-spent.  If it's website access,
typically it wouldn't be a big deal to let the customer have access
for 5 minutes and then cut off access if it's rejected.  Many such
sites have a free trial anyway.

I think I've got the peer networking broadcast mechanism covered.
Each node sends its neighbours an inventory list of hashes of the

all or most of the neighbours should eventually have each item,
even if the coms get fumbled up with one, they can get it from any

it ultimately helps speed more by keeping extra data blocks off the
transmit queues and conserving bandwidth.

It looks like we're through with the worst of the Internet
connection issues.  0.1.3 fixed a problem where your node's
communications could go dead after a while.  The network is
running much more smoothly now with this version.
If you've successfully generated a block, you've seen it has a
maturation countdown before you can spend it.  Once it matures,
the Credit column will change from 0.00 to 50.00.  For a block to
be valid, it has to be broadcasted to the network and get into the
block chain, which is why Generate does not run if you're not
connected.  If you generated a block without being connected, the
network wouldn't know about it and would continue building the
chain without it, leaving it behind, and the maturation countdown
would change to ""(not accepted)"" when your node sees that it
wasn't used",0,emails,email,email_026_[bitcoin-list]_Bitcoin_v0.1.3,026,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_026_[bitcoin-list]_Bitcoin_v0.1.3.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_026_[bitcoin-list]_Bitcoin_v0.1.3.html,[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.3,2

electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it

Another factor that would mitigate spam if POW tokens have value:
there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive
quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from
spam",0,emails,email,email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released,029,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released.html,Bitcoin v0.1 released,3
".  They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the
message.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become
too high for spam to be cost effective.
The process has the potential to establish the POW token's value
in the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could
buy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would
temporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the
self-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the
spammers.
Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of
spam called ""dusting""",1,emails,email,email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released,029,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_029_Bitcoin_v0.1_released.html,Bitcoin v0.1 released,3
".  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust
in order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.
If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're
willing to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a
message with it, users could set how much they're willing to get
paid to receive spam.

"From: | Satoshi Nakamoto | Subject: | [p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency | Date: | February 11, 2009 at 22:37:54 UTC
I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin.  It's
completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties,
because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.  Give it a
try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:
Download Bitcoin v0.1 at
http://www.bitcoin.org
The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's
required to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to
debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of
breaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and
transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit
bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve",0,emails,email,email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency,032,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency,4
".  We have to trust them with
our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.
Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.
A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar
problem.  Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password
protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system
administrator to keep their information private.  Privacy could always
be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the
principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his
superiors.  Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and
trust was no longer required.  Data could be secured in a way that was
physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason,
no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.
It's time we had the same thing for money",1,emails,email,email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency,032,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency,4
".  With e-currency based on
cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman,
money can be secure and transactions effortless.
One of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital
signatures.  A digital coin contains the public key of its owner.  To
transfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of
the next owner.  Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of
ownership.  It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big
problem unsolved: double-spending.  Any owner could try to re-spend an
already spent coin by signing it again to another owner.  The usual
solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for
double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model.  In its
central position, the company can override the users, and the fees
needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.
Bitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for
double-spending",2,emails,email,email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency,032,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_032_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency,4
".  In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed
timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin.  It
takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but
hard to stifle.  For details on how it works, see the design paper at
http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
The result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.
Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with
each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.

It's similar in that it uses digital signatures for coins, but different
in the approach to privacy and preventing double-spending.  The
recipient of a Bitcoin payment is able to check whether it is the first
spend or not, and second-spends are not accepted.  There isn't an
off-line mode where double-spenders are caught and shamed after the
fact, because that would require participants to have identities.

every transaction",0,emails,email,email_033_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency,033,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_033_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,nakamotoinstitute_files\emails\email_033_[p2p-research]_Bitcoin_open_source_implementation_of_P2P_currency.html,[p2p-research] Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency,2

Indeed, it is much like Pekunio in the concept of spraying redundant
copies of every transaction to a number of peers on the network, but the
implementation is not a reputation network like Wizard Rabbit Treasurer.
In fact, Bitcoin does not use reputation at all.  It sees the network
as just a big crowd and doesn't much care who it talks to or who tells
it something, as long as at least one of them relays the information
being broadcast around the network.  It doesn't care because there's no

The current version will work fine.  They'll each connect over the
Internet, while incoming connections only come to the host that
port 8333 is routed to.
As an optimisation, I'll make a switch ""-connect=1.2.3.4"" to make
it only connect to a specific address.  You could make your extra
nodes connect to your primary, and only the primary connects over
the Internet.  It doesn't really matter for now, since the network
would have to get huge before the bandwidth is anything more than
trivial.

Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for
transactions.  A few lines of code could create a transaction with
an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.
I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.

"Helpful suggestions, thanks.Quote from: madhatter on December 09, 2009, 05:34:46 AM- When the bitcoin software establishes a connection with a peer (client TCP socket) have the client send the handshake string. Right now you have the server (server TCP socket) send the handshake. My reasons for this are anonymity of course. It is far too easy for ISPs to portscan clients and detect they are running this program.That's a good idea. Â The side accepting the connection just needs to withhold from sending anything until it receives a valid handshake. Â Any portscan would only get a dead connection that doesn't volunteer to identify itself.Quote- Use some sort of encryption during the handshake (sort of goes with the statement/request above) to obfuscate what the software is during DPI (deep packet inspection).

A simple https receipt mechanism would do wonders. Have the client post each incoming payment to an https url with all of the relevant information and provide status updates. Also an outbound payment mechanism would be nice. So one could automate payments (and batch payments) outbound. Status could be returned via the https receipt interface.That's one of the main things on the agenda after 0.2.Quote- Static port/Random port.

". I'll see if valgrind can help me.Sure feels like it could be something in wxWidgets retrying endlessly because some UI thing failed or something wasn't inited correctly.Â  Our hack to ignore the initialize failure and run anyway means we're in uncharted territory.Â  We're relying on the fact that we hardly use wx in this mode.Â  We do still use a few things like wxGetTranslation and wxMutex.Another way to debug would be to run in gdb, wait until everything is quiet and all threads should be idle, and break it and see which thread is busily doing something and what it's doing.I suspect bitcoind will probably work fine, but I hope you can still debug the problem.

"QuoteHere is a paper that claims to find SHA-1 collisions in 2^52 crypto operations.

Â You can't use a birthday attack for this, so the difficulty is the full 2^160 bits.Â  Although, if you were trying to crack any one of 1 million (2^20) transactions, you could do a partial birthday attack 2^160/2^20 = 2^140.Bitcoin Addresses are the only place where 160-bit hash is used. Â Everything else is SHA-256. Â They're calculated as:bitcoinaddress = RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(publickey))Correct me if I'm wrong (please, and I'll gladly eat crow) but I think it would be hard to use an analytical attack on RIPEMD-160 in this case.

". Â Here, you don't have that kind of control over RIPEMD-160's input, because the input is the output of SHA-256. Â If an analytical attack helps you find an input to RIPEMD-160 that produces a collision, what are you going to do with it? Â You still have to get SHA-256 to output that value, so you would still have to break SHA-256 too.For brute force, RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(x)) is no stronger than RIPEMD-160 alone. Â But for analytical attack, it seems like you must analytical attack both RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256. Â If I'm wrong, then the strength is the same as RIPEMD-160 and the SHA-256 only serves as one round of key strengthening.

The seller can see that the funds are committed to his key and can't be sent to anyone else.Now, an economist would say that a fraudulent seller could start negotiating, such as ""release the money and I'll give you half of it back"", but at that point, there would be so little trust and so much spite that negotiation is unlikely. Why on earth would the fraudster keep his word and send you half if he's already breaking his word to steal it? I think for modest amounts, almost everyone would refuse on principle alone.

". I think you must remove lines 2759-2762. The is nothing like that in the original main.cpp.Sorry about that.Â  CRITICAL_BLOCK isn't perfect.Â  You have to be careful not to break or continue out of it.Â  There's an assert that catches and warns about break.Â  I can be criticized for using it, but the syntax would be so much more bloated and error prone without it.Is there a chance the SSE2 code is slow on Intel because of some quirk that could be worked around?Â  For instance, if something works but is slow if it's not aligned, or thrashing the cache, or one type of instruction that's really slow?Â  I'm not sure how available it is, but I think Intel used to have a profiler for profiling on a per instruction level.Â  I guess if tcatm doesn't have a system with the slow processor to test with, there's not much hope.Â  But it would be really nice if this was working on most CPUs.
